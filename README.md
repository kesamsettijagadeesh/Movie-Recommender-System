# Movie-Recommender-System
This project is a user-friendly application that suggests movies based on preferences. When a user selects a movie and clicks the "Show Recommendations" button, the system provides a list of related movies. Recommendations are generated by analyzing similarities in genres, actors, directors, and other attributes, ensuring personalization.
